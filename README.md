# Portscan and Pingscan BOFs

A portscanner BOF (COFF) that replicates [Cobalt Strikes Port Scanning](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/post-exploitation_port-scanning.htm) functionality including the wide variety of input parameters and provides the same amount of information as it's output.

A pingscanner BOF that perform an ICMP ping scan on target input.

For more information about design considerations and OPSEC notes, BLOG TBD.

## Usage

To run the BOFs use the following commands:
```
portscan [targets] [ports]
pingscan [targets]
```

The following options are supported:
- `[targets]`: a comma separated list of hosts to scan (hostnames and IPs supported). Additionally, you can specify any IPv4 ranges and CIDR (eg. `192.168.1.128-192.168.2.240`, `192.168.1.0/24` )
- `[ports]`: a

### Cobalt Strike

CS already has a builtin portscan command so the BOF's command have been set to the following:
```
portscan_alt [targets] [ports]
pingscan [targets]
```

## Supported C2s

- Havoc: `havoc-portscan.py`
- Cobalt strike: `portscan.cna`
- _Any C2 that can run a BOF (COFF)_

## Build

```
make
```

## OPSEC

The timeouts have been `#defined` in the portscanner bof. Additionally, the number of concurrent sockets is also defined in `portscanner.c`

Some OPSEC considerations have been incorporated into the tool. Nevertheless, needs further improvements, test in a Lab environment before using in PROD.
